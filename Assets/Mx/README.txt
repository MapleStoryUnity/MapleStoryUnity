Mx - command-based completion framework
===
Created by Jen-Chieh Shen(jcs090218)

Mx (or Meta-X) is a command-based completion framework. It allows you to execute all kinds of tasks based on your design.
Mx is an alternate to attribute `MenuItem`; by contrast, doing multiple tasks is possible. It gives you the option to choose and explore unnoticed commands.
